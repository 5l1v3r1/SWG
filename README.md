### What is SWG ?

SWG is a new generation static website generator, featured by the Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org/) template system, born from the need to
have both performances and "WEB 2.0" contents and capabilities.

Given a set of files, one for each page/article, one for each author and one for the categories hyerarchy, SWG will read the configuration file
you specify from command line and generate a complete static website, with tags and categories indexing.

### An example configuration file

    # Path of the db, templates and so on
    datapath   = example-site.com
    # Path of the db
    dbpath     = example-site.com/db
    # DB files extension
    dbitem_ext = txt
    # Category hierarchy file
    hierarchy  = example-site.com/db/categories.txt
    # Templates path
    tplpath    = example-site.com/templates
    # Template cache path
    tplcache   = example-site.com/cache
    # URL of the site you are going to generate
    siteurl    = http://www.example-site.com
    # Site name / description
    sitename   = An example site generated by SWG
    # Site charset
    charset    = utf-8
    # Site language
    language   = it
    # Comma separated site keywords
    keywords   = some, html, keywords, here
    # Site destination basepath
    basepath   = 
    # Site page files output extension
    page_ext   = html
    # Generated site output path
    outputpath = out
    # Items (dirs or files) to copy from datapath to outputpath (eg. static files, css, etc)
    copypaths  = css, images, .htaccess
    # Command to execute once the generation is finished, for instance an rsync :)
    transfer   = rsync -ravz out/* -e ssh user@example-site.com:/var/www/example-site.com/htdocs/
    # Enable or disable the pager on categories, index, tags and author pages
    pager      = true
    # If pager is enabled, this is the maximum number of items per page
    items_per_page = 10
    # Compress pages (ie. index.html.gz) and create (or update) .htaccess file to serve them as html files
    gzip       = true
    # Compression level, 0 to 9
    compression = 9

Pretty self explanatory isn't it ? :)
