###  SWG - Static Website Generator

### What is SWG ?

SWG is a new generation static website generator, featured by the Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org/) template system, born from the need to
have both performances and "WEB 2.0" contents and capabilities.

Given a set of files, one for each page/article, one for each author and one for the categories hyerarchy, SWG will read the configuration file
you specify from command line and generate a complete static website, with tags and categories indexing.

### An example configuration file

    # Path of the db, templates and so on
    datapath   = example-site.com
    # Path of the db
    dbpath     = example-site.com/db
    # DB files extension
    dbitem_ext = txt
    # Category hierarchy file
    hierarchy  = example-site.com/db/categories.txt
    # Templates path
    tplpath    = example-site.com/templates
    # Template cache path
    tplcache   = example-site.com/cache
    # URL of the site you are going to generate
    siteurl    = http://www.example-site.com
    # Site name / description
    sitename   = An example site generated by SWG
    # Site charset
    charset    = utf-8
    # Site language
    language   = it
    # Comma separated site keywords
    keywords   = some, html, keywords, here
    # Site destination basepath
    basepath   = 
    # Site page files output extension
    page_ext   = html
    # Generated site output path
    outputpath = out
    # Items (dirs or files) to copy from datapath to outputpath (eg. static files, css, etc)
    copypaths  = css, images, .htaccess
    # Command to execute once the generation is finished, for instance an rsync :)
    transfer   = rsync -ravz out/* -e ssh user@example-site.com:/var/www/example-site.com/htdocs/
    # Enable or disable the pager on categories, index, tags and author pages
    pager      = true
    # If pager is enabled, this is the maximum number of items per page
    items_per_page = 10

Pretty self explanatory isn't it ? :)

### Example project

You will find an example site in the example-site.com directory, with templates, db and everything else you need to start.

To start a test generation run:

    python swg.py example-site.com/example-site.com.cfg

You will have an output like:

    - SWG 1.1.0 by Simone 'evilsocket' Margaritelli <evilsocket@gmail.com> -

    @ Parsing pages ...
    @ Sorting pages by date ...
    @ Creating 'out' path ...
    @ Importing 'example-site.com/images' to 'out/images' ...
    @ Importing 'example-site.com/.htaccess' to 'out/.htaccess' ...
    @ Importing 'example-site.com/css' to 'out/css' ...
    @ Creating index file ...
    @ Creating 404 file ...
    @ Creating sitemap.xml file ...
    @ Creating feed.xml file ...
    @ Rendering 5 pages ...
    @ DONE

Then upload the contents of 'out' directory to your web server to see the example site.
If you want to test it locally on your machine, you will have to change the line :

    siteurl    = http://www.example-site.com

In the configuration file to something like:

    siteurl    = file:///your/project/path/out

And then simply open 'out/index.html' with your preferred web browser.

Enjoy ^^
